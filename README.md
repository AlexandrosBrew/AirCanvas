# AirCanvas
Air Canvas is a computer vision program designed to allow users with a camera to paint on screen using their hands and gestures. I chose this project to develop my skills in computer vision, python and tensorflow. 

## Prerequisites to Installation
These libraries are needed to be installed om the host computer to work:
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras-Models
  - Mediapipe
  - OpenCV2
  - Numpy

## Instillation
Instal the project folder via github and unzip.

##Usage
Once unzipped, run the main.py file to begin the program and a window with the camera view should turn up.
